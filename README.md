The macro was developed for the use in FreeCAD (http://www.freecadweb.org/).

It helps managing cells inside FreeCAD's Spreadsheet-workbench. With its help one is able to:

       - Cut/delete data and/or alias information in the selected area of cells.
       - Copy data and/or an alias information in the selected area of cells to clipboard.
       - Paste data and/or alias information in the selected area of cells from clipboard.

More information can be found in the FreeCAD forum: http://forum.freecadweb.org/ and in particular on https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=20508&hilit=spreadsheet#p158443 .
